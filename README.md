# Sway Workshops Bounty

### **What We're Looking For**

We are excited to announce the Sway Workshop Bounty, designed to support and empower our Developer Champions to share their knowledge and expertise in Sway, the programming language of the Fuel ecosystem, with the wider developer community. We aim to facilitate workshops at events or within communities to foster learning and engagement with Sway's unique features and capabilities.

Criteria for successful submissions:

- **Eligibility:** Open to Developer Champions who have demonstrated their engagement and proficiency with the Fuel ecosystem. Applicants must have attended or watched a recording of a 'train the trainer' session.
- **Proposal Quality:** We expect detailed, structured, and engaging workshop proposals. Your submission should outline the workshop's objectives, the structure, the topics covered, and the intended audience.
- **Impact Potential:** The workshop should aim to educate participants about Sway, including its syntax, features, and how it integrates with the Fuel ecosystem for building high-performance web3 applications.
- **Community Engagement:** We encourage you to document and share your workshop experience with the community. Social media posts, blog recaps, and photo documentation will enhance your submission.

### **Funding Details**

- **Amount:** $500 USDC for delivering the workshop.
- **Payment:** Successful applicants will be paid $500 in USDC via Request, upon submission of documentation of the workshop happening (social media posts, workshop materials, etc.).

### **What We're Not Looking For**

- Proposals lacking detail or clear objectives.
- Workshops not focused on Sway or the broader Fuel ecosystem.
- Submissions from individuals who have not completed the 'train the trainer' session.

### **What's in it for You?**

- **Support:** $500 in bounty payment.
- **Exposure:** An opportunity to position yourself as a leader within the Fuel developer community and beyond.
- **Community Impact:** Play a pivotal role in educating and expanding the Sway developer community, contributing to the growth of the Fuel ecosystem.
